# Principal-Component-Analysis
I performed PCA for dimensionality reduction for the famous iris dataset.

PCA finds a new set of dimensions (or a set of basis of views) such that all the dimensions are orthogonal (and hence linearly independent) and ranked according to the variance of data along them. It means more important principle axis occurs first. (more important = more variance/more spread out data)
